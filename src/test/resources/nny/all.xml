Interview #1
Interviewee: Bennett Cerf
Interviewer: Mary R. Hawkins
New York City
Sept. 20, 1967





Q: Mr. Cerf, you were born in New York--you're a born New
Yorker--in 1898. Would you like to say anything about that?
Cerf: I think I'm rather an unusual specimen in that all four
of my grandparents and both my parents, as well as myself,
were all born right on the island of Manhattan. My father's
family is Alsatian in extraction, and my mother's family is
German. My mother's family were named Wise. Now, the background
of the family is shrouded in some mystery. I've never
bothered investigating very much my antecedents, except that
I do know that my father's father, Marcel Cerf, was a jeweler,
and my mother's father was in the tobacco business.
The Cerf family was always loaded with charm but not
much money. The Wise family didn't have nearly as much charm
but a lot more money. My grandfather, Nathan Wise, built up
in New York a very big tobacco company called the Metropolitan
Tobacco Company. At one time a young man came to him and suggested
a partnership that my conservative grandfather didn't
think was very good. The man's name was Duke, and he became
the great tobacco magnate. My grandfather thought he was a
wild young fellow, which indeed he was. But at that, my grand-father
when he died had amassed a million dollars for himself.
In those days that was a great deal of money.

Q: Oh, yes--a lot more than it is today.
Cerf: Right. But now the way that money was divided--and this
is important in the beginning of my career--was that he had
remarried. He'd married a very lovely woman some years after
his first wife died, and he had six children. So when he died,
the money was divided in seven parts. The widow got a good
chunk of it, and the six children divided the rest.
Now, I'll have to tell you a few words about my father,
because my mother died the day before I was 16. And I was the
only son, so--

Q: Did you have any sisters?
Cerf: No, I was the only child. But the important thing to
remember is that my father and I were together then from the
day before I was 16 until his death.
Now a word about how my father and mother met. In those
days, when they were young, it was considered quite the thing
for respectable young ladies to take elocution lessons and
recite, you know, “The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck” and
stuff like that. My father, who was a very handsome, charming,
wonderful man--I absolutely adored him and so did everybody
else--besides being quite a ballplayer, gave elocution lessons
on the side and was a lithographer by profession. In about
1892 my pop got a tryout with the Brooklyn Dodgers as the
catcher. The Dodgers were members of a league called the

Players‘League. They had just gotten into the National League.
In 1891, I believe, they got in; and a year after that my pop
trained with them. He had been a semi-pro catcher. On weekends,
he'd catch, you know, and he got a tryout with the
Dodgers, and for the rest of his life we kidded him about not
being able to hit Big League pitching. He would always resent
it, and no matter how many times we kidded him about it, he'd
always give an explanation as to why he hadn't made it.
But anyway, besides learning lithography, which was his
business and in which he achieved some success, he taught elocution.
A few of the labels my father designed are used today.
One of them is Murad cigarettes, and the other one is Blue Label
ketchup. Those two labels were designed by my father many,
many years ago.

Q: Did he have any schooling?
Cerf: Well, he went through high school. I couldn't tell you
the name of it. Girls didn't go to college to any great extent
then, not in the circles my family moved in anyway. My mother
was one of three boys and three girls--there were six children,
as I said--and the girls all took elocution lessons. And the
gentleman who gave my mother elocution lessons was my father.
They fell madly in love, and they ran away together--to the
outrage of my grandfather, who looked upon my father as a
charming fly-by-night. And these two people were gloriously

and wondrously happy for their entire lives. So I was born
into a very happy family.

Q: Where were you born exactly? Where were you living in
New York?
Cerf: I was born in a house that is now in one of the most
rundown sections of New York, 117th Street, just off Seventh
Avenue.

Q: That was country, wasn't it?
Cerf: No, no. But it was certainly not a Negro neighborhood
in those days. It was mostly Jewish. But very early in life
my family moved to an apartment house called the Douglas, which
was at 201 West 121st Street--that's Seventh Avenue and
121st Street--also right smack in the center of Harlem now
in the colored section. But because I lived there, I went to
Public School 10, which was at 117th Street and St. Nicholas
Avenue. This is where my real life began, because in that school
I met some of the people who became lifelong friends.

Q: Would you like to say anything more about your mother?
Was your mother an attractive woman?
Cerf: Well, yes, I can talk a little bit about her. First of
all, she was the most sensitive woman in the world--very easily

hurt. The only trouble I remember in our family was that my
mother would always have some fancied slight to complain about
when my father came home. And when I grew old enough to join
in, we would continually have to reassure her that these people
were not trying to insult her. But she was terribly sensitive.
And this is important in my story, because I've inherited this.
I'm terribly sensitive, too, I'm terribly easily hurt, and
I've passed this on to my older son, Chris, too. Chris and I
love each other very much, but we hurt each other without meaning
to because we're so terribly sensitive. My wife Phyllis
laughs at us, and it is laughable. You know, it's come to a
point where you analyze yourself more carefully than you used
to. I know this weakness. My mother didn't.
Outside of that, she was a lovely, lovely woman; and
she was desperately anxious to have another child. She'd had
several miscarriages and had been told that she just wasn't
strong enough. But she persisted. And when I was 15, a little
girl was born. She only lived about two weeks. Also, it
weakened my mother to the point that less than a year later
she died. I remember it was the day before I was 16 years old.
Well, that was a blow.

Q: Can you remember a first experience in your life--when you
were five or six? Is there anything that you can look back
on that might be the first experience you can remember?
Cerf: Well, the things I remember as a little boy, of course,

are closely associated with Seventh Avenue and 121st Street.
And my grandfather, who was rather a stern man with a beard--
he looked like one of the Smith brothers, is the way I remember
him--he died when I was about 11 years old. I remember him
because on Sunday the family always went to his house. They
had a private house and lived in some elegance. They had the
first automobile I ever saw. Everybody kow-towed to my grand-father.
He had a great backhand. At the dinner table, he could
reach across the table and wallop you over the knuckles with a
marvelous backhand that moved so fast, you didn't see it coming.
And the object was to get as far away from Grandpa at the Sunday
dinner table as was possible.
Then he would take a nap in the afternoon. The house
had to be quiet as a church. I remember I never was quiet
in my life, and I usually was the one who woke him up and got
the backhand.
One of the six children who were my uncles and aunts
was born very late in my real grandmother's life, and his
name was Herbert--Herbert Wise. He played a very, very
important part in my life.

Q: Would you like to go into that?
Cerf: Yes. He was only five years older than I was and never
terribly strong because his mother was 51 years old when he
was born. He was one of the most brilliant people that I have
ever met--absolutely brilliant. When he was at Columbia, he

was the captain of the Columbia chess team and never lost a
match the whole time he was in college. He knew everything.
And when my mother died, he came and lived with my father and
me, so his influence over me was enormous.
Let me tell you a few things about life when I was a
little boy. At that time the New York Herald had a branch
office at 125th Street and Seventh Avenue. In front of that
office was a score board, a baseball scoreboard. A boy used
to come out every once in a while with a rubber pad and stamp
the scores on that board. We kids were great baseball fans.
I inherited this from my father. He started taking me to
games where I used to play at putting the seats up and down.
I went to ball games when I was five years old. So we would
stand there after school and watch the scores being posted.
There was no radio in those days, no television. Of course
we were great Giant fans and always hated the Dodgers even
though Pop had played on the Dodgers. They were the enemy.
Howard Dietz was one of the boys. He became a well-known
playwright later on. He wrote “The Bandwagon.”
One of the other graduates of that school was Morty
Rodgers, who became a great gynecologist and delivered my two
sons. His kid brother, whom we used to kick around the house
and tell to “Get out of here” became reasonably well known,
too. His name is Richard Rodgers.

Q: You were talking about the score board. Did you go out
and watch the score board as they were putting up the scores?

Cerf: You see, it was in front of the window. We used to
congregate. The cops used to push us aside--we were blocking
traffic. But everybody was interested in baseball in those
days, much more than they are today. And the fact that there
was no radio or television influenced us. We waited until
that boy came out and put those numbers up; and as he came out,
we'd say, “What happened?” But he was playing God, so he
wouldn't even answer us until he stamped those numbers up.
But P.S. 10 was a great school.

Q: Did you start there right in kindergarten?
Cerf: I went to some private kindergarten for a year, but I
don't remember it very well. I know it was at Mt. Morris Park,
to which Dick Rodgers has just given a fire tower.
We were all kids around there. For Public School 10
the alumni association is still active. In fact, last year
we went up while Mayor Lindsay put a plaque on the building
where it used to be. They've torn it down and put up a housing
project now. It should have been torn down even when I
was a boy. It was already old then, and it lasted until about
two years ago--the school, the building. But the teachers I
remember as if it were yesterday. Students when I went there
included Morty Rodgers; Ben Grauer, the television man; and
Judge Shallet, one of New York's best judges.

Q: Were there any experiences before you started school that
you can remember? Did you go away for the summers or did you
spend your summers here in New York?
Cerf: Well, one thing: my mother, to my disgust (I was her
pride and joy, of course--the only child), dressed me in
Buster Brown collar--you know, with a bow. The first day I
went to Public School 10 (it was a very tough neighborhood;
the Irish kids were over around Manhattan Avenue and Eighth
Avenue) with that Buster Brown collar and bow, I became the
center of their attention. I came home with the collar ripped
and my nose bleeding and screaming with rage. I wasn't angry
at the boys that did it. I was furious with my mother. That
was the last day I ever wore a Buster Brown collar. Either
I changed my costume or I wouldn't go to school.

Q: You spent most of the first ten years of your life in the
city. You didn't get out...
Cerf: I never got out of the city. My father was a very
proud man. We lived on what he made. It was distinctly middle
class. There was never any trouble about money, because my
grandfather was, as I told you, for his day a very wealthy
man; but my pop wouldn't touch any of my mother's money. Of
course she really didn't have any, but he wouldn't let her go
to her father. So I was brought up as a kid playing in the
streets, playing stick ball with a bunch of tough little kids,
a lot of whom became very famous later on.

      <text>

Q: How do you account for that? Is there any way you can
account for so many people...?
Cerf: Well, in those days playing in the streets wasn't as
dangerous as it is today. Automobiles were just beginning.
And you could play punch the ball out in the middle of the
street and not have to run to the sidewalk too often. Traffic
was not one-one hundredth what it is today. New York was quite
a livable place. We used to roller skate all over the town
hitching onto ice wagons. It was also great to reach in and
steal little pieces of ice. We were pretty wild kids. As I
say, we were on the edge of a tough neighborhood, and we were
tough little kids.

Q: Did you ever read during that period you were going to
school? Did your uncle encourage you at that point?
Cerf: Well, he was only five years older than I was, but when
I was a little boy, he was in a different world. I didn't come
under his influence until later. I'll come to that. But just
as a child graduating from P.S. 10, I was salutatorian of the
class, second in the class. I was a pretty smart kid. I
didn't work too hard. I never have. But then we moved...

Q: In your spare time, I mean, you were out on the streets
playing. You weren't sitting home reading a book, in other
words.

Cerf: No, in those days we read a couple of magazines that
have gone out of existence. First of all, the Saturday Evening
Post was popular already, and all of us used to sell the Saturday
Evening Post. You got prizes for selling the Post, and you put
a white bag over your shoulders with copies of the Saturday Evening
Post in it. It cost five cents in those days. You parked
yourself at some subway station or somewhere else, and then you'd
get prizes according to the number you sold.
But the magazines that I remember with particular affection
were called Popular magazine and Top-notch magazine. They
had baseball stories and the football stories and adventure
stories--very tame by present-day standards, but we liked them.
The books I remember starting with were the Rover Boys and the
Motor Boys and the Putnam Hall Cadets. And then I remember one
day there was a branch of the public library at 123rd Street
and Lenox Avenue that we all belonged to, and we all discovered
together an author named Ralph Henry Barbour. My, was he popular.
I still remember the names of some of the books--The
Crimson Sweater, The Honor of the School and Four in Camp and
Four Afloat. This was a step up from Top-notch magazine. This
was a first step up.

Q: Did your parents ever encourage you to read?
Cerf: Yes, my mother always liked to read. I read the children's
books of the day, like Black Beauty and Rebecca of
Sunnybrook Farm. But as to the really good books, they didn't
really know about them.

Q: What kind of a religious background did you have? Was
the home religious?
Cerf: Absolutely none. Absolutely none. Both my mother and
father were Jewish, but I never was inside a Temple. A lot of
the kids in the neighborhood announced they were going to be
Bar Mitzvahed. You know, when he's 13, a Jewish boy becomes
a man. They all got bicycles for being Bar Mitzvahed, so I
demanded to be Bar Mitzvahed, to the absolute amazement of my
mother and father, who said, “Well, if you want to, we're not
going to stop you, but where did this idea come from?” I didn't
tell them I wanted a bicycle. So by heart I learned the Bar
Mitzvah. Never knew what it meant, never knew what I was saying,
never went to a Temple again from that day on until when people
would die and I would go to funerals. Then what soured me on
religion permanently was that my mother wouldn't let me ride
the bicycle in New York, because it was too dangerous. So I
thought the whole thing was a fraud.

Q: How about politically? Did they have a certain view at
all? Were they conservative or liberal or...?
Cerf: Their lives were absolutely middle class. Everything
they did was regular, was in conformity with the day. They
never had a radical idea. Anybody in those days who had any
money at all or any possessions was Republican. The Democrats
were the socialists. The thought that anybody in our family

would ever vote for a Democrat would be like today joining the
Communist Party.
But we moved--and this was the beginning of things--
just about the time I graduated from public school, which was
in 1911. We moved uptown, up to Riverside Drive and 157th
Street to a great big apartment house called The Riviera. It
had just been built, and I remember we were on the 12th floor.
We looked out right over Audubon Park on the Hudson River.
Here was where I would say my life really began. The days
when I was a little boy in public school I remember with
pleasure, but the beginnings of my real life started when I
moved up here.

Q: I just want to go back one moment. Are there any teachers
that you remember at P.S. 10?
Cerf: Oh, I can tell you the entire faculty.

Q: I mean when you think of what came out of that school it's
amazing. There must have been something or some influence
around there that these people could break out.
Cerf: I'll tell you a little bit about this.

Q: I think it's interesting to bring in as history of the
times, too.

Cerf: There's still an alumni association. It's one of the
few public schools that has one. Even though the school has
been torn down, there are still people who come back every
year, people who graduated in 1905 and '06, to a meeting where
we reminisce and scream with laughter. It was a great school.
They don't have public schools like that anymore.

Q: Why was it great?
Cerf: The principal was a man named Dr. Birkens, whom everybody
adored. The teachers there included one man named Abe
Greenberg. He was the coach of the athletic team. He was so
good that P.S. 10 won the inter-scholastic championship year
after year after year.

Q: Were you ever on any of the teams?
Cerf: I was on the relay team, the relay race team.

Q: How about baseball?
Cerf: I was always near-sighted. But I could run and I was
on the relay team. P.S. 10 always won. There was another
school, P.S. 86, which was the only other real rival we had.
Then there was a fellow named Mr. Birch who taught
science. Now, as I look back, I think he must have been a
little crazy. He was the butt of all the humor of the school.

He was a little man with a little brush mustache and perpetually
in a terrible temper. The boys used to drive him crazy.

Q: What did he teach?
Cerf: Science. Imagine teaching these little ruffians science.
There was a closet in the back of his room with flasks in it,
Florentine flasks--you know, flasks with long necks. And the
favorite occupation in the school was to break the key on that
lock, and we would all pee into these Florentine flasks. And
every time he'd come into class, he'd find these flasks filled
with the urine of nasty little boys. Then he would start lecturing
and screaming. And he'd send pupils out of the room.
He kept a little book. He'd say, “There are four green checks
against your name. Go to your prefect,” and we would go marching
triumphantly out of the room. He must have been crazy.
But to this day when boys from P.S. 10, now men of 70 years old,
meet, they imitate Mr. Birch and then we scream with laughter.
I'll never forget Mr. Birch. I was one of his pet hates because
I was always doing tricks in the school, always causing
some kind of commotion.

Q: Was there anybody at the school who--?
Cerf: --started inspiring us?

Q: Yes, exactly.

Cerf: No, except that it was a good school and they had
good teachers and we learned.

Q: Do you think you worked hard?
Cerf: No, but the school had great spirit, and we were very
proud. And to be a student at P.S. 10--we considered it a
privilege. It was like a college. We were proud of our school.
There were a lot of smart kids around there. It was a predominantly
Jewish neighborhood, mostly German Jews. If you've
read Our Crowd, you know that to the German Jew years ago the
Russian Jew was an affront, because it was the influx of hundreds
of thousands of Russian Jews that really caused the
prejudice in this country. The German Jews were quickly assimilated.
And to this day there are certain clubs where
Russian Jews are tacitly excluded. If you read Our Crowd, you
find that to the well-born German Jew, it was the Russian Jew
who caused most of the anti-Semitism here.

Q: Did most of the students at P.S. 10 go on to college?
Cerf: No, but they went to high school.

Q: P.S. 10 was only through eighth grade?
Cerf: Eighth grade--through 8-B. That's all there was in
those days.

Now, then, there were three high schools that most of
the kids uptown went to, leaving out the Brooklyn schools and
the Bronx schools. You didn't get around as fast in those days.
The three high schools that we were divided among were Commerce,
Clinton, and Townsend Harris. Commerce and Clinton were down-town,
relatively, in the '60s. Townsend Harris was part of
City College of New York. The remarkable part of it was that
it provided in three years what the other high schools did in
four years. And to get into Townsend Harris you had to have
superior marks in public school, and when you got there, you
had to work like hell. And the dropouts were fantastic. In
the first year over half the class flunked out. It was so good
a school that after some years, after terrific fights down at
City Hall, Townsend Harris was abandoned. The building was
needed by the college anyway. It is part of the City College
complex up on 138th Street and Amsterdam Avenue.

Q: Is that where you went?
Cerf: Yes. Now, those are the three years that I really worked.
I mean I worked harder in high school than I ever worked in
college. College was a breeze after Townsend Harris. And it
was at the Riviera, this building up on 157th Street, that I
started out my real life, because in this building it was
Howard Dietz, who had moved uptown, who became one of my best
friends. Another was Merryle Rukeyser, who later became financial
editor for all the Hearst newspapers. And across the

street DeWitt Wallace lived and a boy named Elliot Sanger, who
came up from Dallas and whose father was of the Sanger family
who owned one of the great stores down in Dallas. We became
a group of kids who were really quite exceptional, and we all
went to Townsend Harris. It was only a mile away. We used
to walk together. It was at Townsend Harris that I met another
student, who was a year ahead of me, named Irwin Edman, who
became quite a famous philosopher and the head of the Columbia
philosophy department.

Q: It was an exceptional bunch of children, but do you think
the faculty had something to do with it?
Cerf: Well, now, at Townsend Harris I began to read books,
real books, and began to get interested. Now, my father, besides
being interested in baseball, was also a theater buff
since he had taught elocution. So at a very early age I became
interested in the theater, and I've never got that out of my
system. To this day walking backstage at the theater gives me
a thrill. And anybody connected with the theater I have respect
for--the fellow who opens the door to the dressing rooms
or the chorus girl. She doesn't have to be naked or pretty for
me to be attracted. The fact that she's in the theater makes
her important to me. I've never gotten this out of my system.
There's star dust still in my eyes.
We weren't given too much money to spend. I had an
allowance, as I remember, of a dollar a week. We couldn't

really indulge ourselves too much. But at this time there was
a vaudeville house on Seventh Avenue between 125th and 126th
we called the Alhambra. This was big-time vaudeville. We were
regular patrons. Remember, movies were just starting. We were
just beginning to go to five-cent movie shows--you know, three
or four one reels for a nickel. These were in stores; old,
abandoned stores. One was called The Nickelette, another was
called The Nickelodian.
Also, at this time, I had my first piece published in
the St. Nicholas magazine called “How I Spent My Vacation,”
and I got a silver badge for it. The reason that I remember
it is that some fan this summer sent it to me; found it in an
attic!

Q: Did you have a copy of it already?
Cerf: I'd forgotten all about it.

Q: What was the St. Nicholas, a newspaper?
Cerf: Oh, no, that was a magazine for kids. Every kid read
the St. Nick. It came out once a month. It was a famous
magazine for boys and girls.

Q: What did you do during your summer that you wrote about?
Cerf: I think I made the whole thing up. I talked about the

joys of coming back to school.
Anyway, at Townsend Harris we began going to the theater,
first, almost every Saturday, to the Alhambra. We'd sit up
in the balcony. I think a ticket cost 25¢. We'd worm it out
of our mothers and all of us went. There was a candy store
right next to the theater called Simonette's--with caramels.
We'd get a half a pound of Simonette caramels in a light blue
box, and a whole bunch of kids would divide them up. That
meant about three caramels for each of us. I can still remember
this with pleasure. As I tell you this, the taste of those
caramels is still there. There were chocolate and vanilla
caramels. They were great.

Q: Who did you go with? Did you go with any of these people
you mentioned before?
Cerf: Oh, sure. Then a love came into my life. There was a
little girl who lived across the street whose books I used to
carry to school. Sometimes, if I could worm an extra quarter
out of my mother, I'd take her--about once a month. She was
cute.

Q: Do you remember any of the books you read or any of the
courses--?
Cerf: I told you--the Rover Boys. This was in public school.
Now I went to high school. In high school you had to read

Ivanhoe, Silas Marner, The Oregon Trail. That was the kind of
stuff we had to read. At least, I loved Ivanhoe, and that
started me on Walter Scott. Then I began reading a little bit
better books. I was still reading popular magazines. I wasn't
an exceptional kid. I was a New York kid.
In those days there was a cut-rate ticket agency at
43rd Street and Broadway called LeBlang's Ticket Agency, and
they would sell tickets to shows that weren't sold out, and
you could get an orchestra seat for about a dollar--of course
way in the back, you know. Then Howard Dietz and I began to
haunt the theaters on Saturdays. We became great friends because
we both loved the theater. We didn't know there was
anything in front of the 14th row. To us that was no man's land.

Q: Do you remember anything you saw at that time?
Cerf: Well, yes. The first big show I think I saw was called
“Top o‘the World,” a musical show. But Dietz, who later became
a great lyricist, you know, and vice-president of MGM,
entered a contest that was given by the Strauss Theater Program
Company. They printed all the programs for the theaters. You
were given three lines of a poem and you had to write the
fourth line, some kind of a little jingle. Dietz won one of
the prizes. This was the beginning of his career. And the
prize was two seats in the sixth row of the orchestra for the
Astor Theater Saturday matinee. I don't remember the name of
the show, but I remember the theater. Dietz invited me--and I

treated him to lunch. We both remember to this day we ate
lunch at a place called Lauber's at 39th Street where we got
an eight-course luncheon for 65¢. We had to show the cash
before they would give us lunch--you know, we didn't look like
regular patrons. We were kids, a couple of kids in short
pants. And we went and sat in the sixth row center of the
orchestra. That to me was such a thrill that I still remember
walking into those seats and the pride we had sitting there.

Q: Did you discuss with Dietz anything about the show
afterwards?
Cerf: Oh, we were both stage-struck, terribly.

Q: Would you hang around backstage at all to try to see the
stars?
Cerf: The first hanging around we ever did was not for a girl--
it was for a man. There was a pitcher on the Giants named Rube
Marquand. The Giants had bought him from some other club for
$11,000--these are the idiot things you remember as a kid--and
that was a lot of money to pay for a ballplayer in those days.
He was a great big tall left-hander, and he was awful when he
started, and he became known as the $11,000 lemon.
But then in one year suddenly Rube Marquand blossomed,
and he won 19 straight games, which is a record that has never
been equalled since. It still stands. You talk to any baseball

buff and mention Rube Marquand and they'll say, “Oh, 19
straight.” The $11,000 lemon became a great hero. He lived
near us somewhere or other, and we used to stand in front of
the house waiting for Rube Marquand to go in or out and we'd
say, “Hey, Rube,” you know, and wave at him.

Q: That was a real thrill.
Cerf: You bet! Well, in those days Washington Heights was
not quite built up yet. There were still empty lots where we
could play ball. Right south of where the Washington Bridge
is, big apartments were just beginning to be built, like the
Riviera, which is still standing there. You could look out
of my window and watch the trains go by on the west side tracks
of New York Central, and the great pleasure was watching the
boats to Albany go by with the searchlights playing from one
side of the river to the other as they went up. There were
about four. A couple went to Albany; a couple went to Troy.
The night boat to Albany was great. I didn't realize that many
of the passengers were fellows with other fellows‘wives, so
they didn't see the scenery at all; they were in the staterooms.
But people did go to the Adirondacks. You'd take the night
boat to Albany, and then you'd take a train. It was wonderful.
I remember going to camp on that night boat, and the actual
thrill of being on a boat instead of watching it from the
window.

Q: Did you go to camp at about what age, would you say?
Cerf: Twelve till about 15 every summer I went to camp.

Q: Well, that was sort of a broadening experience, being out
of New York.
Cerf: Yes, I was with Morty Rodgers. Then later on when Dick
started to grow up, Dick Rodgers and Larry Hart.

Q: Another one!
Cerf: He was at P.S. 10, too.

Q: Did you have to have a tie and coat?
Cerf: Oh, sure, and we got very fancy. I remember hats were
two bucks in those days. On May 15th, every man in New York
got a straw hat; September 15th, out. This was the rule. And
if you wore a straw hat after September 15th, you were fair
game. People would tear it up. Anybody who came to a ball
game. after September 15th with a straw hat on would be mobbed.
But they were only $2. I remember Rukeyser (he was always
the pompous one in our crowd) arriving at Riverside Drive and
Broadway (there's a sharp drop down to the Drive) one day with
a derby on. This Dietz and I considered an absolute outrage.
We were tough kids, you know. And Dietz and I understood each

other perfectly. Without a word we pulled the derby off his
head and kicked it all the way down to Riverside Drive. By
that time it was a thing of rags and patches. It was a very
unpleasant occasion, because he went to tell his mother, who
complained to our mothers, and we had to buy him a new derby,
which was $1 apiece for this $2 derby. That was a real dent!
The next day he arrived with that new derby on. The temptation
was great. Dietz and I looked at it longingly, but we couldn't
afford it.
Another boy who lived in our building was Herbert
Matthews, the famous Times man who got into trouble defending
Castro. He just retired a few months ago.
There was yet another boy there, whose name I won't use.
He had a sister who was about a year older than we were. We
were all about 14, 15. And she was very blonde and very pretty,
and I still remember Dietz and I paid this boy a dime to watch
his sister take a bath. She splashed around while we sat and
watched. That's the first time we understood a girl's anatomy.
I still remember that lesson.

Q: You never know what's going to stick in your mind.
Cerf: Oh, that sticks in everybody's mind. I still remember
that girl. She was giving us a strip tease.

Q: In the bathtub, no less. That's better than what you pay
for in a show.

Cerf: I remember she flipped water on us, but we remained
happily till the performance ended.

Q: I know that you went to Columbia after Townsend Harris.
I was wondering whether you'd like to elaborate on something
about the scholastic--
Cerf: Well, now, there's an interlude here. After two years
at Townsend Harris, I met a couple of boys who were working
and making what I thought was a lot of money. I wanted to
get in on the action. One of the boys was named Louis Young,
whose father owned a chain of hat stores: Young's hats. They
were very big. There were Youngs all over town; that was their
slogan.
One funny story about that: One May 15th they couldn't
get enough clerks. Everybody bought a hat at the same time.
And we all got a job--$5 for the day to sell hats.

Q: Was school still going on?
Cerf: Sure.

Q: You'd just play hooky.
Cerf: That one day, May 15th, sure. It was a shambles. We'd
pull hats out, and we didn't know the stock very well. I
remember my great feat that day. It was supposed to be for

two days, but I only worked one day, because I boasted out
of turn. This man came in and wanted a hat and I brought one
to him. And he said it wasn't quite big enough--he wanted to
see the next size. So I clumsily knocked over about four
piles of hats but I couldn't find the right size, so I brought
back the same hat and sold it to him, convincing him it was a
size larger. When Mr. Young heard about that, he wouldn't let
me come back the second day. He said I was destroying the
reputation of his store. He was right!
Also, during the day, Babe Ruth came in to buy a cap.
So now I decided I was going to learn to be a businessman.
My handwriting was very bad; I didn't know anything about
bookkeeping or anything like that, but I decided I was going
to be a business tycoon. My mother had now died. My father
had no influence on me. From the day my mother died, I became
the head of the family. Pop adored me, but I was already
stronger than he was. And to make matters worse, my grandfather
had sized up my father very accurately. He was a very shrewd
man. He loved my father, but he didn't trust him with money.
Pop would have lost it in a year. He was the soft touch of
the world. If anybody asked Pop for money, he gave it to them.
So my grandfather had left the money to my mother in trust
for me. When she died, I got the money, which amounted to
just about $125,000. That was my share of that fortune. Pop
didn't have it. But I adored my father, and it all worked out
well because I turned out to be pretty good with money, and
Pop was quite happy. I became financial head of the family
at the age of 16.

Well, this is when I began to be interested in high
finance, so I quit Townsend Harris and went to the Packard
Commercial School, which was at 35th Street (it's gone now)
and Lexington Avenue. This was a mighty stupid move, but
luckily, it worked out well for me. First of all, it changed
my handwriting. You know, you did the Palmer method in those
days. I also learned double-entry bookkeeping and began to
know something about the business world. After school I began
working for a certified accountant and going around to check
books. In this way I got backstage of a big restaurant and
learned that all the money's in liquor, not in food; in a big
department store, and various different businesses, and got
interested in all of them. I got a lot of experience while I
was still in the business school.
Meanwhile, my uncle, the one I told you about as having
a great influence on me, was raging at me that I had given up
college. And after about eight months--I wasted a whole year--
he said, “You've got to go to college.”
Well, after this year at Packard and working for this
accountant, he talked me into going to college; and of course
without it, God knows what would have happened to me.
I had no credit at all. I hadn't graduated from high
school. I decided about in January that I was going to college
if I could. So I had from January until September to get all
my entrance requirements. So this meant taking extension
courses. I went to Columbia and took several courses. My
uncle, who, as I said, was brilliant, coached me in a couple

of other things. And I got enough points to get into the
Columbia School of Journalism.

Q: Would you like to describe your uncle a little bit--what
kind of person he was? He must have had some influence on
you. Was he a quiet man?
Cerf: He was a most amazing man. In the first place, although
I loved with him for seven years, I never knew that he was
completely homosexual. In those days, nobody talked about
this. He was ashamed of it. I never knew it. If I may jump
ahead, by the time I was 24, we had gone to Europe together;
he had lived in my house for years but the idea that I had an
uncle who was homosexual never entered my head. Then one night
we were walking up Broadway. By the time we had moved to
75th Street, my Uncle Herbert, it seemed to me, had been talking
about nothing but famous homosexuals for a full half hour.
Suddenly I stopped and said, “You know, it seems to me that
you are becoming obsessed with the question of homosexuality.
Did it ever occur to you that there must be some of this in
you or you wouldn't be talking about it so much?”
And I can still hear my uncle saying, “Well, you goddamned
fool, I've been trying to tell you for five years and you
wouldn't listen to me.” I almost went through the sidewalk.
Then the interesting part was my reaction. He had never
told a soul. I was the person he loved in this world. And we
walked home together, and he was dying to see what my reaction

was going to be--you know, was I going to spurn him. And I
sat there absolutely lost in thought, and he said, “What are
you thinking about?”
I said, “How could I have been such a fool not to have
caught on!" The fact that he was a homosexual didn't mean
anything to me at all; it was only rage at my own stupidity!

Q: And you kept up your relationship--?
Cerf: Well, that's an interesting part of the story. After
we stayed up all night talking--he had pointed out all the
times he had tried to tell me and that I unconsciously didn't
want to hear it... Finally he said, “Do you think I can tell--?”
He had a best friend down in Wall Street. I'll tell you about
him in a while. He was a big, husky, outdoorsy fellow. I said,
“His reaction will be the same as mine. He's only going to
be outraged that he didn't guess it.”
So Herbert went down and told him, and I was absolutely
correct.
So this made my uncle so confident that now he went
from one extreme to another and began boring everybody in the
world by telling them about himself. At last he felt free to
live with another man, which was what he really had wanted
to do all the time.

Q: I'm deeply interested. Obviously your uncle had an influence
on you at a time in your life where it was most important.

Cerf: He started me reading good books, and now he was instrumental
in getting me to resume my education.

Q: When you left Townsend Harris to go to Packard, did they
say anything? Did they try to encourage you to stay on?
Cerf: Oh, sure. I was by this time writing stories for the
high school magazine. I was one of the top students there.
And also, I was on the soccer team. I could see a soccer ball!
But I was determined I was going to make money. And when I
started working for the accounting firm, suddenly I was making
about $50 a week.

Q: Plus all your mother's money, too.
Cerf: Well, that was untouchable to me. Pop at least had
enough sense to say, “That's got to start you in business some
day. Put that away.”

Q: How did you start writing? Was there one teacher who
encouraged you to do this?
Cerf: In public school I wrote an entire little newspaper by
hand. You're born wanting to do things like that.

Q: Is this why you chose the Columbia School of Journalism?

Cerf: When I started taking extension (I had to amass 15 points
to get into Columbia) I quickly decided after looking the field
over that I could never learn any Latin or Greek. I had none
at all. And I discovered that at the School of Journalism you
didn't need Latin or Greek. So then and there I decided that
the Columbia School of Journalism was for me. It was then an
undergraduate school. It became a graduate school some years
later.

Q: But you did get your B.A. there, didn't you?
Cerf: I got my B.A. at Columbia College and my B. Lit. at
the School of Journalism. I did both. I started wheeling and
dealing when I got into college. That was the real start of
my career.

Q: Did you meet any of your present friends at this time?
Cerf: Yes. In Extension, a couple of things happened to me
that were important. First of all, Morty Rodgers had the next
locker to me in gym class, and we became friends immediately;
we've been friends ever since. I went home with him, and there
was little Dick, and Morty's father, Dr. Rodgers to me.
Dr. Rodgers was a very famous man because one of his patients
was my dream girl, Norma Talmadge. Do you remember Norma
Talmadge?

Q: No, I don't, but--

Cerf: Oh, God! Well, she was a beautiful moving picture star,
and the idea that she was one of his patients dazzled me. I
remember pleading with him: could I carry his bag when he
went to see her?
It was Morty Rodgers, too, who introduced me to the
fraternity I joined: Pi Lambda Phi. The head of the fraternity
was young Oscar Hammerstein. Also, in that fraternity were a
couple of people who have been my best friends all my life--
notably a boy named Horace Manges, who today is not only the
lawyer for Random House but a half dozen other big publishers,
too.

Q: Did you live at home during your college days?
Cerf: Oh, always. We lived at 157th Street. It was three
subway stations down. You got on at 157th Street, off at
116th Street.

Q: Did you take your own money and pay for your college education
from the money you'd earned or from your inheritance?
Cerf: Oh, sure. Pop just about made a living. He was selling
for my two uncles--Herbert's two older brothers. They had a
hosiery business, which was quite successful, and they loved
being recognized by officials. They used to give free sox to
the entire police department of New York, so that when they'd
ride in their car down Fifth Avenue, they'd be recognized. My

uncles agreed that it cost them a fortune, but they were hailed
by the police! Pop was a great salesman. Everybody liked him.
He'd work faithfully, too--until the ballgame started, and
then he'd be up at the Polo Grounds!

Q: You started out and decided you wanted to be in the School
of Journalism....
Cerf: I decided I was going to enter the School of Journalism.
I got just enough points. I never could do algebra at all,
and I had counted on two points for algebra. Then I knew I'd
flunked the entrance exam. I simply couldn't do it. I had
two points to make up. So I remember I went in and took an
exam in freehand drawing, which any idiot could pass, and I
passed that. That was one point. Then, instead of taking
intermediate French, I took advanced French. This was taking
a desperate chance, because if I didn't get that last extra
point, I was dead. But I passed it, so I got into the School
of Journalism.

Q: Was that the following September?
Cerf: That was the following September.

Q: What were your initial opinions when you got to Columbia--
do you remember?

Cerf: I was just an ordinary kid, just a smart young boy, very
naive, with a wild love of books and the theater. That's the
way I would describe myself.
Well, now starts my life at Columbia. The first thing
that happened to me was that one of my freshman classes in
the School of Journalism was with a professor named Harrison
Steeves, and I will never forget Professor Steeves, because he
started me reading really good books! This was a course in
modern literature. And suddenly young Bennett discovered
H. G. Wells, Arnold Bennett, John Galsworthy, Kipling--literature.

Q: Did you get excited about it?
Cerf: Did I! A new world opened for me. I discovered that
when I was given these books that I had to read, I loved them,
truly loved them. I paid Dr. Steeves back. I published a
dreadful detective story he wrote later on.

Q: You never know what's going to come back to haunt you!
Cerf: Well, then I went out for the college newspaper, too--
the Spectator. In my freshman year a lot of things happened
to me. First of all, I was already in a fraternity. I didn't
have to worry about that as freshman do. In those days getting
into a fraternity was very important. I was set. Second of
all, on the Spectator the fellow who had written a column had
graduated, and was now working for Associated Press. So they

had the problem: who was going to write that column? I submitted
several columns, and suddenly, in my freshman year, I
was the columnist for the Columbia paper! Well, this was an
open sesame to everybody and everything.

Q: Do you remember who the editor was at that time?
Cerf: A fine fellow named James Harrison, Jim Harrison. Heaven
knows whatever happened to him.
The head of the School of Journalism then was named
Talcott Williams.

Q: I know that name.
Cerf: Oh, he was a famous man. The School of Journalism in
those days was a very famous school. In various classes were
Dietz, George Sokolsky, Morrie Ryskind, Corey Ford, Richard
Simon, Max Schuster (Simon and Schuster). Come to think of
it, Simon was in the College. It was Schuster who was in the
School of Journalism.
When the freshman class assembled, I don't know how it
happened but I was elected vice-president of the class. I
don't know why, because at that time I was nobody. I hadn't
even begun to develop but I must have been a little above the
norm. A boy named Guy Williams was made the president, and I
was made vice-president. The tradition was that newly elected
presidents and vice-presidents of the freshman class went in

to meet Talcott Williams. Talcott Williams was a little man
with a bushy white mustache who had spent most of his life in
the Near East--in Turkey and in Palestine and in Egypt. That
day he confused the two of us, and through the entire School of
Journalism he thought I was Williams and Williams was me.
About six times we tried to correct him, but we finally said,
“The hell with it.”
Anyhow, teaching there that time were Pitkin, who wrote
Life Begins at Forty; and Kendrick, one of the great history
teachers of the country; and over at the College were Beard,
and Odell, and Brander Matthews. It was a great faculty in
those days. I had a new world opened up for me, an absolutely
new world.

Q: Did you have some administrative ability as vice-president
of the class?
Cerf: That didn't mean anything at all. But that's when I
started to be a faker. The first essay we had to write was
“a brief story of my life.” A week later, the prof said, “This
is by far the best paper that was turned in. I'm going to read
it aloud. It's a little bit unfair because this fellow's had
experiences that are worth telling about, and the other fellows
haven't.” So he read my paper aloud and gave me an “A” on it.
And when it was over I went to him and told him that I'd lived
in New York all my life and had made the whole fish-tale up.
He crossed out the “A” and gave me an “F.”

Well, the column became popular, and then I began sending
in little things to the Jester, the funny magazine. And at the
end of my freshman year, the rich kids in my fraternity began
taking me down to their country clubs. I didn't know what a
country club was until then. This was also a new life for me,
which I liked very much. Luxury and I agreed very well. So
I began meeting a new set of girls and learning expensive new
habits.

Q: What did your father think of all this?
Cerf: Pop? Anything I did was o.k. with Pop!
Then one of the boys in the fraternity told me about a
girl. My aunt and uncle had a house down in Elberon, New Jersey,
and he told me about a little girl there that he thought was
mighty cute. I didn't quite trust him, but I made a date with
this girl. My uncle's chauffeur drove me there, and I had him
wait around the corner for 20 minutes, because I said, “If she
turns out to be a dog, I'll fake a bloody nose or something.
You wait for 20 minutes.” Well, she was my girl straight
through college. He didn't have to wait for me.

Q: Do you want to mention her name?
Cerf: Her name was Marie Mayer. She had red hair and a little
turned-up nose and freckles, and she was absolutely adorable.

Q: Do you know what's happened to her?
Cerf: I talked to her the day before yesterday. She lives in
Louisville, Kentucky.

Q: Was she at Columbia?
Cerf: Barnard. She was a kid then. When I met her she was 16
and I was 18. She had a little white canoe, and I remember we'd
paddle it on Deal Lake, New Jersey. There was a night club
there, called Ross-Fenton Farm, which was beyond our means, but
with all the other kids we'd settle back in our canoes and
listen to the music. There was a young couple dancing there
at the time, and we met them down at the dock one day and
liked them. They used to sneak Marie and me in once in a while.
And the reason I remember them very well was because the boy
married the girl, and the boy was named George Murphy, who is
now the Senator from California.

Q: You know, I think it's often amazing how many people in
one person's life developed into something.
Cerf: Now at Columbia began meetings. This great class of '17
was just graduating. Schuster was still wearing short pants
when he went to college. Dick Simon was in the college. I
was in journalism '20; he was in college '20.

Q: Were they both members of your fraternity?
Cerf: Neither was. I'll tell you how I met Dick Simon. He
was in the college; I was in journalism. I soon had discovered
that if I played my cards right, I could get two degrees at
the same time--a B.Lit. at journalism, and a B.A. at the college--
without doing too much work. This required manipulating, but
that I thought added to the fun. And as the columnist of the
paper, I was beginning to be a big shot.

Q: I'll interrupt for a minute. Did you write your column
at home?
Cerf: Yes. It was called “The Stroller.” It was not a gossip
column. There were little pieces about personalities on the
campus.

Q: Did you ever take up public issues?
Cerf: Oh, sure. We had fights over the mayor of New York and
the dismal subway service and demanding that 116th Street be
made an express station--that kind of stuff.

Q: Would people ever approach you and say, “Why don't you take
up this cause?" or “I like what you did.”
Cerf: Sure! “The Stroller” column was lively. It was read!

Q: Did you ever have a run-in with the president or the dean
about something that you wrote?
Cerf: The first run-in I had was at Barnard. They had an
annual event there called “the Greek games.” I think they still
have it. The girls have chariot races, javelin throwing, and
do a lot of prancing around in flimsy costumes. Rule 1 was
that no Columbia boy was allowed into the Greek games. But
my girl was a Barnard freshman! By posing as her brother I
got into the Greek games and wrote what I thought was a hilarious
piece about them. I covered them like a burlesque show--talked
about their beautiful fannies, etc. Dean Gildersleeve of
Barnard took umbrage at this and raised hell with Talcott
Williams demanding that Bennett Cerf be kicked out of college
or suspended forthwith. So good old Talcott of course grabbed
Guy Williams immediately and started bawling him out. I told
you he always mixed us up. Williams kept trying to say, “I'm
Guy Williams. I'm not Cerf.” But Williams went right on, and
finally Talcott Williams burst out and said, “It's a very funny
piece. Don't worry.” So Williams came to me and said, “You're
safe. Gildersleeve is raising hell, but Williams thought it
was a very funny piece so you're safe.”

Q: Did you ever have any other experiences with the Spectator
of someone trying to stop what you were saying? In other words,
did they ever threaten you at all?

Cerf: I don't remember. It was a very mild time. Except right
at the beginning of my career at college we got into the war.
We got into the war in 1917. This played a big part in our
lives. At that time there was something comparable to the
ROTC; it was called the SATC, the Student Army Training Corps.
We all became members of that and got uniforms. One of my
first exploits in that was the day I was commander of the
company, and I had them in company rank marching across South
Field, which is now all covered with buildings. But as they
were walking toward the grandstand, I panicked and I couldn't
think of how to stop them. So to their intense delight they
went marching up to the grandstand, the whole company, while
the real officers screamed with laughter. I was not cut
out for an army career. But anyway I made a good story of
all this.
What became important was that our dean had a son with
a club foot, but I wangled him a job as supply sergeant in the
SATC. He had a uniform, and he gave out the blankets and the
uniforms and such--and was happy! The dean was very grateful
to me.
Then came the call for officers‘training school, and
I got into the infantry officers‘training school down in
Camp Lee, Virginia, bucking for Second Lieutenant.
I was the night editor of the Spectator shortly thereafter
when the rule came through that anybody who was going
away to the war would get credit for all the courses he had
signed up for before he went away.

      <text>

Q: Even though he didn't have them.
Cerf: He didn't have to take them. This was the beginning of
October. So I had this notice the day before it went to the
paper. I rushed over to sign up for all the courses I could.
And I came to the dean for an okay of all these extra courses
I was taking. The dean, whose son I had helped, looked at this.
He said, “This is an interesting course you've planned out. I
figure it would take about 16 hours of home work a day to
really do this course.”
I said, “Really, sir?”
He said, “You haven't by any chance seen the rule that
you're going to get credit for everything you've signed up
for when you go away to camp?”
I said, “I don't know what you're talking about, Dean.”
He said, “I didn't think so,” and he stamped his approval.
So off I went to war and got credit for advanced geometry,
something I could never do, and a couple of other courses
where you have to be exact. I was terrible at those things.
In history, economics, literature I was great. I'm very good
at adding figures, too, but when it comes to algebra or quadratics
or geometry, I'm absolutely hopeless. But I got the necessary
credits.

Q: Did you graduate then as a result?
Cerf: No, that was in my sophomore year. I was then at Camp Lee

until the war ended just as I was getting my commission. I
got out and came back a hero, having won the battle of Camp
Lee, Virginia. I went back to college, had credit for all
these courses that I never could have passed....

Q: Did you keep up your column when you came back?
Cerf: Yes. Then also when I came back, Morrie Ryskind, who
was the editor of the Jester, was kicked out of college for
the simple reason that he called Columbia's prexy, Nicholas
Murray Butler, a blithering idiot, and I was made editor of
the Jester. In my sophomore year I was made editor-in-chief
of the Jester! That was heady stuff!

Q: Do you remember your experiences at the Jester at all?
Cerf: Yes. The first issue of the Jester that I edited
gave me a chance to meet Nicholas Murray Butler.

Q: What was that like?
Cerf: There were only two ways you met Nicholas Murray Butler.
One was to give a million dollars to the University, and the
other was to print a joke in the Jester that he didn't like.
I chose the latter method.

Q: Do you remember the joke?

Cerf: I certainly do. The art editor was George W. T.
Gillette. The reason we made him art editor was that he not
only drew pretty well, but his father was head of the Gillette
Safety Razor Company, and we felt this was going to get us
quite a lot of advertising. It did, too, but he paid us off
in Gillette blades. But anyway at this time there was a dance
craze called “the shimmy.” The shimmy was a very interesting
dance. You took a girl and you stood in one spot and you
bounced up and down. If you had the right girl, it was an
exhilarating dance! I wrote a joke, and Gillette drew the
picture--a full-page picture--of a couple shimmying on the
floor, with a big fat Englishman sitting at a ringside table.
The caption was: “Lord Hemingway, what do you think of that
couple doing the shimmy over there?" and Lord Hemingway's
answer was: “All I can say is: 'I 'opes he marries the girl.'”
This enabled Mr. Gillette and me to meet Nicholas Murray
Butler. We went in and he was sitting there behind an empty
desk. He looked at us--he was a pompous man--and said, “The
first thing I'd like to point out to you two gentlemen is that
English lords do not customarily speak with a Cockney accent.”

Q: Well, he must have had some sense of humor.
Cerf: Well, the two of us said, “Yes, sir:”
And he said, “The second thing I'd like to tell you is:
Anymore of that vulgar type of humor and you two gentlemen will
follow Mr. Ryskind out of this university so fast you won't
know what happened to you.”

And we both backed out. This was the only time in my
life I met Nicholas Murray Butler.

Q: Did you heed his words?
Cerf: I managed to evade him from them on.

Q: Did you change the policy of the Jester at all? Do you
think you got more circulation?
Cerf: Well, there were a couple of funny things. One incident
I'll tell you about. I started a drama column--to get free
tickets. Then I thought, “This is my chance to meet one of
my film heroines, Norma Talmadge.” So I wrote Norma Talmadge
that I wanted to interview her for the Columbia Jester, and a
letter came setting up a date. Well, the whole campus knew I
was going to meet Norma Talmadge, I want to tell you that: I
was so darn excited about it. But when the day came for the
date, I lost my nerve; I was afraid to meet her. Isn't that
ridiculous? I never went. I faked the interview. I wrote
a glowing interview--made the whole thing up and ran it in
the Jester and sent copies down to Norma Talmadge. I got a
warm letter from her in return saying she had enjoyed meeting
me so much and that the interview was masterful and she hoped
we'd meet some day again soon. This letter was framed and put
up in the Jester office.

Q: Did anybody else know that you hadn't gone?
Cerf: Oh, later on, not then. I suppose the press agent wrote
the letter for her. I met her years later and told her this
story and she screamed with laughter.

Q: You started this drama column. What other new policies
were you able to institute?
Cerf: In those days, you see, there was no New Yorker yet.
Now every college magazine in the country imitates the New
Yorker or fills its columns with pop art, camp, and humor that
I can't follow. I'm delighted to say that both my boys worked
on college humor magazines. Chris, the oldest boy, was the
vice-president of the Harvard Lampoon. Jon, my youngest boy,
is now president of the Lampoon. They're two amazing kids.
Chris is going to have a book published by Doubleday this
October (1968).

Q: A collection?
Cerf: All the little things he's written for the Lampoon and
other pieces done since. He's a great boy. They're both
great boys.
But, anyway, this first interview gets me into college!

Q: I still want to find out a little more about the Jester.
I'm sure you must have done quite a bit with that.

LH
Interview #2
Interviewee: Bennett Cerf
Interviewer: Mary R. Hawkins





Q: I know you started a theater column in the Jester. This
is sort of where we left off. I was wondering if the circulation
increased while you were editor.
Cerf: The circulation was more or less fixed because the
students, as I recall, got the Jester along with some other
things for a small payment--the Jester, the Spectator, the
varsity show and things of that sort.

Q: You weren't concerned about the financial end?
Cerf: Well, we were because we had to get some advertisements
to make the magazine big enough. And my object was to
make it more of a magazine than it had been. You know, it
had been pretty slender. Also, there wasn't enough stuff
being turned in. So my object was to build the Jester up.

Q: How did you do this? I know you showed me this when we
went upstairs. For instance, you showed me the book column,
which was new.
Cerf: Yes, the book column was new. The theater column had
been thrown out years before. There had been one. The first
thing I did was to look up all the old Jesters and make notes

about some of the things I thought had been good over the
years that had been discarded by other editors. Every editor
of the Jester had his own way of doing things. We had a
strange system in the Jester. The board didn't elect its
editor. The outgoing editor appointed his successor.

Q: Now, you were made editor in your sophomore year.
Cerf: Yes. That was when Morrie Ryskind was thrown out of
Columbia. As I told you, he called Nicholas Murray Butler a
blithering idiot, and Nicholas Murray Butler didn't like that.
I think I told you how after our first issue we met Nicholas
Murray Butler when we printed a joke he didn't like. Well,
that's the last time I saw Nicholas Murray Butler. I never
ran into him again, because I wasn't there to get my diploma.
I had it sent by mail. I graduated ahead of time. Butler's
behavior was quite different from the way college presidents
act today. Today I think college presidents have to speak
the language of the students and know what they're thinking
or they're no good at all. In my day, the main job of the
president was to get money for the university.

Q: I think that's a good part of his job today.
Cerf: Sure, it is. But he's somebody in the college who knows
the students. Nicholas Murray Butler had no more knowledge
of his students than he did of the man in the moon.

Q: You were editor of the Jester for three years.
Cerf: No, I was not, just for two years. You see, I got
out at the end of my junior year.

Q: We haven't brought this out yet. You might want to go
into that.
Cerf: Well, in my sophomore year, while I was editing the
Jester, the war was on and we got into it.

Q: You did go into how you got credits.
Cerf: Yes, I got credits when I went off to the officers'
training school. But luckily for me the war ended just as
I was being made a second lieutenant. In those days, the
lieutenant was the man who led the troops over the top of the
trenches. Second lieutenants were selling for about two for
a dime. But I got back to college then, and I had credit for
all the courses by this time that I couldn't do. So it was
kind of a joy ride for me to finish in three years--by going
to summer session after my junior year. All I needed were a
few more points. So I never had to go back for my senior year.
Now, I think I told you that before going back to Columbia
I had worked for one year in Packard Commercial School and
had gotten some outside jobs, so that I had a pretty good
sense of business and double-entry bookkeeping by the time I

got out. I got out at the end of the summer, although I
didn't get my degrees until the following spring. I had
made Phi Beta Kappa in my junior year.

Q: That's another thing. Today, you know, we have to do a
thesis usually in our senior year--not a Ph.D. thesis, but
a thesis...
Cerf: No, I didn't. You see, it was wartime and we got away
with murder. And I was very good at getting away with murder,
especially since I had this pull with the dean.

Q: Well, Phi Beta Kappa was just on your grades...
Cerf: That I earned. I earned that because all the courses
I did were the ones I was good at--English, economics, history.
Anything where I could just talk and have a good time I was
very good at. The things that would have murdered me were
the exact sciences, which I got the credit for without doing
them. I was fooling nobody but myself. But, you see, I never
had one word of Latin, never one word of Greek!

Q: Do you miss that?
Cerf: Not the least bit. Really, I don't. I think most
students who take Latin and Greek and say they get something
out of it get little or nothing. Maybe one student in a

hundred benefits. If you're going to be a serious author,
I suppose it's good to have had Latin in your background.

Q: For research.
Cerf: Yes.

Q: There are a few questions that I thought of. We discussed
your decision to go with Pi Lambda Phi fraternity. Do you
think that it was a worthwhile experience?
Cerf: Being in a fraternity?

Q: Yes.
Cerf: I think at that time it was nice, because it was some
place to have lunch. I don't believe in fraternities. I
think they're an undemocratic process. Maybe the system's
all right now, because I don't think it's one-tenth as
important as it used to be. But in my day frats were almost
a social necessity. A boy who was not in a fraternity felt
pretty well out of things, and I think that was particularly
true at other colleges, less so at Columbia because it's in
a big city.

Q: Did you make friendships there that were to continue?

Cerf: Absolutely. First of all, as I think I told you, one
of the main reasons I joined Pi Lambda Phi was that Hammerstein
was the head of it. Richard Rodgers soon joined it. That
fascinated me. That got me more and more interested in the
theater.

Q: Would you like to discuss either Oscar Hammerstein or
Richard Rodgers at this point? Did they change at all?
Cerf: I didn't see an awful lot of Oscar Hammerstein after
college. We remained friends all through his life. First,
though, he went off to Hollywood. He had written a couple of
musicals, and it was through Oscar, I guess, that I had my
first romance with an actress, who was a girl named Edna
Hibbard in a show of Oscar's called “Tumble Inn.” She was so
pretty! I demanded to meet her. Oscar was the stage manager.
The show was produced by his uncle, Arthur Hammerstein. I
met her and took her out several times and thought I was being
a devil. After the show closed, she went to Boston. The
last time I saw her I remember her kissing me on the forehead
and saying, “You're the cleanest, decentest boy I ever met.”
I was outraged.
At that time I had discovered serious reading. I told
you, didn't I, about Professor Harrison Steeves? It was he
and Raymond Weaver at the School of Journalism who changed my
life. Through both of them the world of real literature
opened for me. As I told you, when I went to Columbia I was
