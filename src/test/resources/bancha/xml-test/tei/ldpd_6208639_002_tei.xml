preface.
 

eight long months have now elapsed since this publi¬
cation was undertaken, in the fond hope and belief that
the whole would have been published in half that time ;
and although my labours, during this dreary period, have
very frequently been protracted till two in the morning,
at the risk of totally ruining my health, the volume at
last has been completed, with the utmost difficulty and
distress, from causes over which i had no control what¬
ever, those readers only, who will make a proper use
of this cheap but comprehensive abridgment of huge and
costly volumes, can form a competent idea of the task,
projected and executed under many discouraging events;
in a manner so very different indeed from such perform¬
ances in general, that no one can form an adequate no¬
tion either of its practical utility or extent, until he fairly
put this multum in parvo collection of words to the
test of daily experience, in its application to the two
most essential of the eastern tongues.

the rational ideas of genuine etymology, which may be
acquired in my text books and lectures, will be corro¬
borated and exercised at every step through the closely
printed columns of this vocabulary, with the most bene¬
ficial effects, and a certain practical acquaintance with
the arable vocables, which are incorporated with the
hindoostanee and persian, will thus be cultivated by a
process of reference and concatenation that must insen¬
sibly produce a degree of proficiency in this department
of orientalism, which will speedily reward the learner's
assiduity with astonishing success.

having been so long and unexpectedly engaged upon
this hindee-persic and english vocabulary, which alone
contains from 20 to 30,000 words, it became absolutely

impossible to overtake the projected reversed one with
much, if any advantage to my scholars, in whose hands
there already exists not only a large english and hindee-
persic collection of ^be most necessary words, but an
ample store of thousands more, among the four other
publications that compose the set of class text books j
whence every industrious student may now cull and
arrange, at his leisure in these sheets, enough to answer
all practical purposes in persian and hindoostanee for
some time to come.

should the appearance of this extraordinary lexico¬
graphic attempt to condense and preserve the digestible
kernels of some ponderous oriental fruits within the com¬
pass of anutshell only, meet with adequate encouragement
from my own pupils in particular, and the british Indian
community at large, this may induce me to carry and
execute the design still further, of forming a complete
double dictionary, at a reasonably low price, in due sea¬
son, without retaining the smallest portion of the chaff',
refuse, and husks too visible in the common run of lexi¬
cons, .on the contrary, it is my earnest desire to leave
all such rubbish or offkl wholly untouched, for the sole
gratification of those learned pigs, who are too fond of
wallowing with their disciples prematurely among the
recondite garbage of useless pedantry, or the distracting
superfluities of eastern literature, when they would be
infinitely better employed by merely teaching them to
open their mouths intelligibly in their several more
natural capacities of rational tyros, on the two most re¬
quisite tongues for adventurers of every kind, the whole
of whom, by starting hence, merely with colloquial pro¬
ficiency, may thus ultimately turn out orientalists of the
greatest utility or renown in british India.

for the want of oriental characters in this perform¬
ance, and the rigid exclusion of capital letters, my plea
still consists in the preference of utility and simplicity to
all other considerations in the outset of every scientific
pursuit; and when it is duly observed, that the M^hole of
these variegated symbols A Si a ^^ tz al \ 1 ^T "311

which without the help of any second sight, we can
instantly perceive through a wall in our own tongue,
one can hardly refrain from smiling at so much ado
about nothing at ail: we must not however, with the
aberdonians pervert the word wall to well, lest we
search in vain for what in this case cannot be found,
either at the top or bottom of a well, and though truth
itself is said to reside there, it is quite evident, that the
a of wall alone, for every reasonable purpose of com¬
municating its true pronunciation to the british public,
is equal to the long string of multifarious symbols above;
scarecrows that may be aptly enough compared with the
terrific wigs and their bashaw tails or awful curls, which
too often conceal, in high places or posts, many an empty
skull from vulgar gaze and contempt, these being at
best, when divested of exterior embellishments, little
better than a barber's block, with their brains on the
outside of the head, instead of being within that capital
member of the human body, where they ought.

if we judiciously carry this argument through all the
alphabets in the world, and apply it to each of their
component parts, nothing more is wanted for reconciling
us at once to the universal adoption, improvement and
use of roman letters in preference to their oriental substi¬
tutes, especially in cases like the present, where simpli¬
city, facility, brevity, perspicuity, and cheapness of price,
are objects of primary importance, until the persi-arabic
or nagrce characters become absolutely indispensable, at
the proper time and place.

to the hindoostanee and persian students, who will
trust me as their guide, it may be safely affirmed, that
the set of my five books, now procurable at the rate of
as many pounds only, will be infinitely more useful for
the speedy acquirement of both languages, than much
larger and dearer volumes, that stand the purchasers
eight guineas at least for instruction in the hindoostanee
alone, on principles, too, which have not yet produced
one good practical scholar in the course of many years,
for every score who have learned that useful tongue from
me since 1817 *&#8226; in that^ and the successive seasons, not

PREFACE.
 

fewer than five hundred hindoostanee colloquists have
departed, as excellent orthoepis'ts with various degrees of
grammatical proficiency, from my institution, whose
studies were avowedly commenced and conducted on
the plan of immediately forming intelligible, rational
speakers of living dialects, in preference to their be¬
coming premattu'ely, either mere bookworms or very
profound adepts in any dead or classical language,
though shrouded under the most venerable and attractive
hieroglyphics of antient or modern times.

for the arrangement of the vocables in this vocabulary,
i have followed the alphabetical scheme exhibited in the
story-teller and guide, preserving the leading feature of
classing words rather by their consonants than vowels;
except in those composed entirely of vowels and semi¬
vowels, as in the first and second pages, where the reader
will observe that n is not reckoned a consonant, because
it is not only often omitted altogether, but occasionally
so slightly expressed as hardly to be noticed by a mere
learner of this useful tongue, the division of the alpha¬
bet into labials, &amp;c. has of course thrown several con¬
sonants together as one letter, with the most beneficial
effects for a stranger in the east indies, obliged to ac¬
quire a colloquial language, frequently without much
previous instruction, and consequently exposed to in¬
numerable blunders, which nothing but a knowledge of
and immediate reference to this work can possibly
rectify, let one set of examples, from hundreds that
might be produced, suffice to illustrate this part of the
subject to every scholar's satisfaction, in pages 196, 197,
198, kur, kur, khur, khur, khur, kurh, qu,ur, quhur,
kuhar, kar, khar, karh, khar, khwar, khawur, gur, ghur,
gurh, gar, gar, ghar, ghar, which undoubtedly makes
every possible allowance for bad speakers and worse
hearers, by thus classing a great number of consonous
words together; and as this scheme is, after all, a
mere extension of the eastern mode of arranging b, p ;
ch, j ; k, g, as congenial letters, it cannot reasonably
be much objected to by those who are already accustom¬
ed to such a classification of similar sounds; particularly

PREFACE.
 

after seeing the valid reasons here assigned for such
collocation or juxta position of numerous words that
cannot well be discriminated by the ears of hindoostanee
novices, though their eyes and tongues, once properly
exercised, will establish an indelible barrier from the
first between all consonous vocables,

many letters in the oriental tongues being interchang-
able, and the hinduwee systems not possessing some
that are found in the persian or arable, or vice versa, no
person can be surprised at the necessity i am under to
obviate the inconveniencies of such confusion, as far as
possible, by the mode adopted in this volume; a careful
and progressive perusal of which will soon convince
every unprejudiced mind, that no pains have been spared
to render it adequate to the rapid acquirement of etymo¬
logical dexterity and acumen proposed here, indepen¬
dent of its use as a comprehensive vocabulary, at first,
considerable difficulty may occur, while consulting these
sheets for words required in a hurry, to those especially
who have not already studied the foregoing initiatory
vohimes ; but this will vanish before a few persevering
trials, and an attentive inspection of the alphabet as
hereafter exhibited.

a hyphen is always introduced to shew the component
parts of derivatives; u-bul, pith-less, page 4 (6), and to
connect the various portions of compounds, or one word
with another, ab, hur, &amp;c., pages 3 (4), 11; varying its
position according as the particle or word may prove a
prefix or an adjunct; thus, wufa-da.r,faith-ful, be-wufa,
faith-less, page 4 (6), with many more of the same sort in
every page of the present volume, it occasionally shows
that the u or e, &amp;c. may be retained or not at the will of
the speaker, as undesh-u, undaz-u, har-a, war-ee
pages 8 (10), 12: but when a is so divided, it com¬
monly denotes the masculine sign, convertible to ee in
the feminine or diminutive forms, bet-a-ee, son, daughter.

the constant recurrence in this vocabulary of the sig¬
nificant particles, explained in the guide, will admirably
familiarize the hindoostanee tyro with their nature and
use in that language; nor will the repeated instances of

arable formations prove less beneficial to his progress in
the former tongue, upon mere mechanical principles,
illustrated in pages 188 to 200 of that work, the whole
of which may greatly facilitate, but never can retard
his future acquirements as a learned and general orien¬
talist.

the u final is in the hindoostanee so slightly sounded
as to be almost mute in nuo,u, shcoroo,u, mushroo,u,
tamiu, tabiu, and might, as far as orthoepy is concern¬
ed, be omitted, were its preservation here not essential
to the orthography, agreeably to the orthoepigraphical
ultimatum, by which all the latest of my publications
have been regulated.

that some deviations, in point of orthography, may
be detected by very profound orientalists, i will not
deny, but they never can prove of much detriment to
those who mean to content theirselves with as much
hindoostanee as will prove essentially useful, and scho¬
lars farther advanced in the learned languages of the
east can at all times correct the errors to which i allude,
without running the risk of being misled by them.

a few words will appear to be, or may have been mis¬
placed ; still, a very little patience and research will
discover them at no great distance from their proper
places, by recollecting that ng, nk rank with the n only ;
and if the learner will reflect on the first syllable fre¬
quently standing alone at the head of numerous deriva¬
tions, these can seldom escape his notice entirely; thus,
kum-bukht, wretch, occurs under kum in page 179,
and na-dan, ignorant, page 79.

to those who may reasonably expect many more words
in these sheets than some dictionaries even contain, i
shall observe, that this is much larger than similar col¬
lections in general are; and to arable or persian profi¬
cients, who will naturally wish to find a great number
of hinduwee vocables, i may state, that, in a work pro¬
fessedly for beginners, it becomes my duty to furnish
them with the most common, useful words in the hin¬
doostanee, without regarding their source as arable,
persian, or sunskrit, of which, more or less changed and

corrupted, the grand popular speech of India is evidently
composed.

no person should consult this volume indiscriminately
till well acquainted with the conjugation of the hin¬
doostanee and persian verbs, because he may otherwise
have to make twenty references, where one for the im¬
perative, preterite or infinitive only would suffice; a re-
markwhich may justly embrace all thenumbers, the other
parts of speech, as well as the yerh, on similar grounds,
the whole having been fully stated in the guide.

all compounds being generally divided by hyphens
into their constituent parts, the learner will soon acquire
a facility of finding such words, either in one place or
another: thus, be and na, the privatives, are so common,
that it is not easy in the vocabulary to insert the many
derivatives from them, but by referring to the word, to
which these particles are prefixed, little doubt can re¬
main as to the meaning of such a compound; the learner
will therefore commence with the habit of extending
this observation, as far as possible, to all vocables under
similar circumstances, and in a few weeks he will be
fully aware of the beneficial consequences of this prac¬
tice, in reading any portion of hindoostanee or persian,
the learner, if disappointed in his search for any word
whatever, should carefully examine it as a compound
of certain initial, medial, or final particles, and separat¬
ing these from the root, he must then look for this ra¬
dical member in its appropriate station as a simple word,
though even in that state it may prove a derivative itself,
from the component letters alone being more significant,
merely in that humble capacity, than superficial ety¬
mologists can easily conceive.

i take it for granted, that the reader already considers
the terminations ee, sh, and t, are for the most part
feminine, from his recollection of my remarks on the
gender of nouns, in pages 99, &amp;c. of the guide; he must,
however, make due allowance for many exceptions in this
very intricate part of hindoostanee grammar, which too
often puzzles the best informed natives, and can be
learned perfectly from great  practice only,    in short.

PREFACE.
 

every dubious noun should be treated as masculine, until
the reader learn that it be really feminine, such a mistake
being much less observable than the reverse ; and it will
frequently happen, that some of the words in a sentence,
must point out the gender of the one more immediately
sought after in this work, which may then be noted
accordingly.

the plan and arrangement of the subsequent vocabu¬
lary will appear, after due inspection, not less useful than
eccentric; properties that may so far preserve it and my
projected double dictionary from the devouringjaws of the
black sheep and cattle, who have already fattened upon
my oriental pastures, and moreover scare any of pharaoh's
lean kyne also who may yet venture upon the same pre¬
mises ; which will, i trust, belong distinguished by certain
traces of originality, or rays of genius, thatdo not abound
in similar labours of some ungenerous competitors, who
have unfairly thriven upon my works, and at my ex¬
pense, by means that need not be explained in this place.

those readers only who have attended my course of
lectures, or who have had the benefit of instruction from
students of my school, will be able at once to appreciate
the extensive utility of the present concentrated perform¬
ance; but as the book may yet fall into the hands of many
individuals who have enjoyed no such advantages, they
will find the annexed key well adapted to unfold the
whole project at one glance, if sufficient attention be
given to the subjoined particulars, after consulting my
three class books, which are at present in general circu¬
lation and repute.

1. the vowels (which, agreeably to my system, runthus,
u, a, o, 00, oo, uo, w; i, ee, e, ue, y) have a very limited
influence in the classification of vocables here, but their
relative rank, such as it is, will be best seen and under¬
stood in the three first columns of the vocabulary, where
it will likewise be noticed that the aspirate h and french
nasal n are treated, along ivith w and y, as mere vowels
also, and consequently are not of much account in the
progressive position of the words, where w, y, h, or n
form their component parts.

b, p, f, V; n, ng, nk; 1; r ; d, t; s, sh, z, zh; j, ch;
k, kh, g, gh, and q; are in a manner reduced to nine
only, agreeably to the semicolon subdivisions just enu¬
merated : whence it is obvious enough, that although,
for weighty reasons, m be preserved distinct from the
other labials, they are nevertheless treated as one letter
only: an observation also applicable to the nasal, den¬
tal, sibilant, dento-sibilant series and guttural classes;
among which, neither I nor r being very admissible, these,
like m, have still been kept as separate letters entirely.

3.  this arrangement has, in the first instance, been
productive of one great but advantageous deviation from
ordinary lexicography, by throwing every consonous
word, independent of orthography, into juxta position,
whence every one with an initial vowel, semivowel, or
aspirate, commences in the fourth column, page 2 (erro¬
neously marked 4), and closes at page 28; in the second
column of which the initial consonant m begins, fol¬
lowed by all the rest of its own section, in regular
progression, till they terminate with the gutturals in
page 47, whence the initial labials likewise proceed on
similar principles, that shine through the top of every
leaf to the end of the vocabulary in page 219, and on
which the consecutive series in every lexicon, as well as
the present, is more or less grounded.

4.  that every scholar may instantly find any word re¬
quired, the audible and leading consonants of each are
inserted by way of head columnal letters, which will, in
general, point out the object of his research, with very
little extra trouble; but shoidd he occasionally encoun¬
ter some small difficulty, even after learning my new
lexicographic and alphabetical system well, let him so
far reconcile the apparent defect by looking for ivo7y
and ugly in the common dictionaries of his mother
tongue, until longer practice in the present scheme shall
render it quite as easy and familiar to every hindoostanee
colloquist as any english or latin vocabulary.

5.  such a plan as mine necessarily implies that b, p, f,

q; are in their respective series indiscriminately only
one and the same generic sound, while m, 1, r, are treated
as individual symbols, which, though interchangeable
with others, should stand independent and apart from
all their occasional substitutes; it moreover embraces
the convenient idea, that vowels, semivowels, aspirates,
and french nasals possess little relative value, in the lexi¬
cographic collocation of words, whose stability of pro¬
nunciation depends almost exclusively on their more
durable consonants.

6.  every language has some prominent feature that
discriminates it from all others ; the multiplicity of words
seemingly consonous, and the difficulty of pronouncing
each with sufficient accuracy, form those grand linea¬
ments of the hindoostanee, which not only thus consti¬
tute a tongue sui generis, but actually exhibit an al¬
most insurmountable bar to its accurate acquisition,
until this has been seasonably removed by the methods
pointed out in the text books and adopted in my lec¬
tures.

7.  persons whose organs of hearing and speech have
been little improved, in their own or any language,
through the ordinary means of tuition at home, enjoy
the opportunity of seeing in the eccentric columns here
the absolute necessity for such a correct enunciation of
hindoostanee abroad, as all my publications have from
the first inculcated, with the laudable view of teaching
my disciples, not only to speak to the natives of british
India as gentlemen or rational beings, but in this way to
avoid those fatal, ludicrous, or obscene blunders, the
probable occurrence of which must now stare the in¬
quisitive reader in the face, from the first to the last
page of these sheets.

8.  besides a very ridiculous abuse of the letter r,
hundreds of englishmen are in their vernacular speech,
most perversely both aspirants and non-aspirants of
the letter h, with no other inconveniency, however,
than the stamp of vulgarity that so glaring a defect
might imply ; but when they carry these plebeian mar¬
plots into the hindoostanee tongue, decency may fre-

ba,ee; choot, chhoot, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. thus become prepos¬
terous and convertible terms, which would often subject
the colloquist to this silent or audible reproof from those
whom he may then address :

" immodest words admit of no defence;
" for want of decency is want of sense."

because even ignorance, in these days of improved orien¬
talism, ought not to be considered as an adequate apo¬
logy for any british sojourner in India, who may be
holding the place of either an officer or a gentleman,
our vulgar blunders of ill, hill, ell, hell, edge, hedge,
&amp;c. never can tumble us into such a ditch as some of
the hindoostanee misnomers, just stated, would occa¬
sionally dig with an unpolished or fallible tongue, in the
head of a defective orthoepist.

9.  suppose an, wan, ban the objects of research, n being
the regulating letter of their station in the vocabulary,
the scholar begins and turns the pages over until he per'
ceives n at the head of the column, which he will find in
page 6 (erroneously marked 8), where, at the bottom,
an, wan, ban are perceptible, and, from the relative rank
oi a,, preceding oon, uon, in, een, uen, &amp;c., rvhich follow as
matters &lt;A course : murd in this way belongs to page 36;
baf, 49; bhar, 57 ; nubee, nufee, 81; luh-na, 91 ; tulwar,
113; shuhd, 145 ; and shookr, 152; which include exam¬
ples more than enough to elucidate every portion of the
work respecting both vowels and consonants; when it
is besides recollected, that na belongs to section n, and
does not occur till page 79, ivhere b, p, f, terminate, and
n begins its own immediate series.

10.  a few days' persevering practice in conformity
with the foregoing references, will greatly contribute to
the learner's rapid progress in hindoostanee, if he at the
same time duly contemplate nam in page 79; lug, 94;
rus, 99; and sur, page 140 ; after having studied the
theory of prefixes, interfixes, and affixes, so fully dis¬
cussed in various parts of the guide.

italic vowel can be transposed to the one which follows
it in ( ), thus new (o) page 79, is either ne,o or new ; a
mode of saving room and repetitions, which has been
successfully adopted, in common with various devices
and abbreviations of this nature, throughout the work,
whence the italic n indicates its occurrence either as the
common n, the french nasal n, or even its omission en*
tirely.

13.  when a word is not instantly found where expect¬
ed, it may at once be traced by looking for the initial
syllable as the radical portion only: thus suh-uj easy, oc¬
curs in page 128, under sub, and in page 149 also in its
own proper place ; but as this double entry is not gene¬
ral, the expedient now recommended may frequently
prove of great use, and sometimes might be extended to
the two first syllables even, as the proper or intermediate
root of the derivative in question; at all events, no assi¬
duous pupil should despair of catching the word he is in
search of, till he pertinaciously try the whole of its di¬
versified etymological fountain heads.

14.  most adjectives, participials, and verbals terminat¬
ing in a have their inflections in e, and their feminines in
ee ; but these can no more be always expected in this
vocabulary, than the plurals in on, or the changes to
which verbs are subjected in their several moods and
tenses, while nouns are of the masculine or common
gender, no discrimination whatever has been deemed
neces^ry, and the feminines have been so denoted in

der by any fixed rules, or when they would otherwise
be treated as masculi/nes from their termination; it must
nevertheless be honestly admitted, that this portion of
my toils requires more accuracy and considerable en¬
largement ; circumstances that will command due atten¬
tion in my projected dictionary.

15.  the significations of words are seldom given with
a or the, because chiriya means, according to circum¬
stances, either a or the bird; when a bird, therefore,
follows as the meaning of words enumerated here^ this
applies to a bird so called, but which has probably no
english name ; a remark that consequently extends to a
plant, a tree, a flower, a fish, or any thing else.

16.  the theory and practice of the elision or transmu¬
tations of short and long congenial vowels are so easy
and simple, after studying the guide well, and the doc¬
trine of moveable particles also becomes so conspicuous
in the same work, that no scholar who learns them per¬
fectly, can encounter much to puzzle him in his pursuit
of simple or compound vocables, by the analytic, syn¬
thetic, and euphonic processes towards that accurate in¬
duction, applicable to all tongues, which will become of
great service under every derivative in the present col¬
lection, when subjected to certain philological opera¬
tions, that must soon be quite familiar to the whole of
those attentive scholars and readers, who do theirselves
and me common justice, by hearing my lectures or
perusing my works, with commensurate assiduity and
perseverance.

17.  occasionally words may appear to be omitted under
their radical constituent syllables, which will be never¬
theless found in the compound form at their proper
place, and vice versa ; see hum in page 2 (erroneously
marked 4), and hum-war hum-rah, page 3. the final m
being much exposed to elision, both in simple and com¬
pound words, its disappearance can thus be reconciled
ivhen huwaldar and such examples are preferred to
huwaludar, v. page 9. ui implies that the arable plural
is at, as in khidm?/t, page 209.

PREFACE.
 

18.  when the meaning of a verb affixed to any noun
or other part of speech is so obvious that the two can¬
not well be mistranslated, the combination is generally
left to the scholar's own ingenuity ; thus hath-oothana to
lift the hand, denotes, among other meanings, to desert,
relinquish, give over, none of which can well be inserted
in the present work, if they should even be deemed
essential in a dictionary, when apparently common to
all tongues.

19.  vocables terminating with ut may be found by
dropping this affix and looking for the preceding sylla¬
bles V. TLi\x\.mpage 79, far ni,um-ut, and qism for qism-ut,
page 213.

20.  as the correction of oo, oo, or i, u, a, even can in
most cases be effected without insertion in the errata,
the scholar must often exercise his own judgment, and
at the worst, since he can seldom be far wrong, it has not
been deemed worth while to notice them or such slight
deviations; and in words where a and u are convertible,
the italics commonly point them both out, as being sub¬
jected to this congenial change.

since the preface to the first part of this work has
been published, various events, which were then unex¬
pected, have rendered some alterations unavoidable in
my future plans : and among the rest that of my large
english and hindoostanee dictionary being now wholly
out of print is the most prominent; but the existing vo¬
cabularies will, for the most part, supply every want for
one or two years more, and the projected double diction¬
ary, when completed in that period, must make this
department as perfect as any industrious scholar could
wish, at a price, moreover, which will not be felt too
heavy for purchasers in general, for whose accommo¬
dation and advantage all my philological efforts have
lately been made, and shall be continued, on the principles
of fair competition, which is all that any honest author
can want.

that some of the roots of various derivatives have been
occasionally assumed improperly is possible enough, but

even this should not at first sight prejudice the learner
too much against them, because it has lately been dis¬
covered, that numerous persian and hindee words have
one common origin, on literary premises, which, how¬
ever remote or obscure, at present, may yet be brought
evidently to reconcile some of the apparent discordances
that may now be recognized in my vocabulary.

a few of the etymologies here may also be rejected by
persons who cannot advert to the motives which led me
to retain them; and among these the luord baghee bubo
might be produced, as one which can have nothing to
do with bagh tiger, until it be recollected that such a
tumour may often prove more than a bugbear, though
not so bad as the cancer, so called from an animal not
quite so terrific as the tiger's whelp, or lion in minia¬
ture, ivhich baghee may be.

it would be unjust in me to close this introduction,
without stating how much i owe in the correction of the
vocabulary to my two most industrious and best pupils,
messrs. rowsell and Jacob, both of whom, and particularly
the former, furnished me with materials for the appen¬
dix and errata subjoined, the formation of which would
otherwise have subjected me to a great deal of more la¬
bour and exertion than was in my power to bestow
upon this necessary portion of the work, their names
have lately been highly distinguished in my last report,
and will, moreover, be found among those gentlemen
to whom this volume has been inscribed in the first part
of the book.

oriental literature in edinburgh.

the rev. alexander nivison has for several years past
taught the hebrew, arable, persian, and hindoostanee
languages, with much success, in the metropolis of scot-
land, where he continues his labours as an oriental
scholar and teacher, on very reasonable terms, and, from
his acknowledged talents and assiduity, with the most
beneficial consequences to all his scholars, to gentle¬
men proceeding to India, the instructions of mr. nivison
will prove truly valuable, especially in the hindoostanee
department of their studies, in which he has made great
progress, and can now communicate a very accurate
pronunciation of that most useful, but in this respect
rather difficult tongue, the medical and military stu¬
dents of Scotland, intended for british India, will find it
their particular interest to attend mr. nivison's hin¬
doostanee class for some time before they leave edin-
burgh, as he has lately been furnished with complete
sets of my text books, that his pupils may be thus ini¬
tiated on the subject of my hindoostanee and persian
lectures in london, under the patronage of the honour¬
able east India company, to which they will, of course,
have access, previous to their departure for India, mr.
nivison's oriental academy is at 19, gayfield-square, edin-
burgh, where his terms for public and private tuition,
in the eastern languages, will be learned from hisself.

the industrious tyro cannot be better employed than in immediately
correcting the work from the errata here j when he may also incorporate
every word of the appendix with the contents of the columns which pro¬
perly belong to each, sometimes the columnal head letters have been
misplaced, as in pages 29, 30, &amp;c. but this can always be rectified by
looking at the words successively, and adjusting the consonants accord¬
ingly 3 thus, page 29 should have mm. mmb. mmn. mml. mmr. instead of
mb. mn. &amp;c. which belong properly to pages 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, &amp;c.
a parenthesis will occasionally be found, as under nur, page 82, to show
that this word alone or nur-ooka, &amp;c. may be used for male, a remark
applicable, of course, to many others thus inserted.
